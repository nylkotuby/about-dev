Tools I like to use, communication style, expectations I have for myself, etc.

# Communication

I bias towards async communication. GitLab has [a great handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) about the how & why of good async comms.

That said, the best communication style is the one that works for both people. When I work with someone who prefers quick calls, I do quick calls. If they prefer scheduled meetings, I do that. I just find that structured async comms are my preferred method.

## Slack

I like to communicate in public group channels as much as possible. This way:
* everyone benefits from the conversation
* duplication of efforts is minimized
* people who you often wouldn't expect have an opportunity to join the conversation and provide valuable context/perspective
* it acts as a form of medium-term documentation

I don't install Slack on my phone unless it's a requirement for the team/company/duration of on-call shift. Because of that, feel free to message or @ me whenever, and I'll get to it when I'm next available!

## PR Review

* I do it proactively when I come up for air between tasks, or beginning-of-day when I'm fresh.
* If you need something sooner, or it's been ~24hr since you last requested my review (passively or actively), please DM me! I can't prioritize if I don't know something's a priority (and sometimes I just forget things).
* I use the [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) style as a guideline for how I format my comments.

# Development

choosing tools
monitoring & observability (you don't know it's working if you can't observe it)

# Values

These are values that I take into all areas in my life, but especially my work.

## Trust

I don't need to give you a definition of trust - I'll tell you the concrete reasons that it's the top of my list when working with people.

Everything is smoother, faster, and feels better when people trust each other. You spend less time talking, crafting words, explaining, hand-wringing, when people (yourself included):
- assume good intent
- ask questions if they don't understand something
- push back if they disagree with you
- keep an open and collaborative spirit

We're not all perfect all the time, but should also trust each other to get back up when we stumble too.

Trust is slow to grow and quick to erode. In other words, it's expensive. I'd rather take on the burden of doing something hard (usually an uncomfortable conversation) than to pay the cost of breaking someone's trust.

Conversely, if my trust is broken, I simply have to spend a little more time on that person or system (emotionally, strategically) than I would with one that I have more trust in.

## Hope

## Do the right thing

## Pace yourself

## People matter the most

## It should be fun

Sure it's work, but it can still be fun.

Solving puzzles is fun (any problem, large or small, is a puzzle).
Finding a better way to do something is fun.
Using a satisfying tool (like a modal text editor) is fun.
Learning something new is fun.
Teaching things is fun.

It's work, but it should be fun.
