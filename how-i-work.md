A bit about how I show up at work.

# Communication

I bias towards async communication. GitLab has [a great handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) about the how & why of good async comms.

That said, the best communication style is the one that works for both people. When I work with someone who prefers quick calls, I do quick calls. If they prefer scheduled meetings, I do that. I just find that structured async comms are my preferred method.

## Slack

I like to communicate in public group channels as much as possible. This way:
* everyone benefits from the conversation
* duplication of efforts is minimized
* people who you often wouldn't expect have an opportunity to join the conversation and provide valuable context/perspective
* it acts as a form of medium-term documentation

I try not to install Slack on my phone unless it's a requirement for the team/company/duration of on-call shift. Because of that, feel free to message or @ me whenever, and I'll get to it when I'm next available!

## PR Review

* I do review proactively when I come up for air between tasks, or beginning-of-day when I'm fresh.
* If you need something sooner, or it's been ~24hr since you last requested my review (passively or actively), please DM me! I can't prioritize if I don't know something's a priority (and sometimes other things just come up).
* I use the [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) style as a guideline for how I format my comments.

## Meetings

As an IC, I've noticed that I'm more productive the fewer scheduled meetings I have. More heads-down time and less randomization means I can spend more time sinking into a problem and being truly effective, or helping out my colleagues when I'm not as deep into it.

Having as many no-meeting days in a week as possible is the best thing I've experienced for productivity and happiness as a dev.

### Standups

I'm flexible and will do any kind of standup the team finds most valuable.

Given the choice, my preference is low-cadence, short-update standups, particularly asynchronous ones. I also think synchronous standups are great if part of the intent is to get the team together to simply talk a bit.

In my experience, it takes a lot of intention from the team to retain value from high-cadence standups. It's easy for them to be a place for people to summarize their JIRA tickets for the day, or worse, become a dumping-ground meeting for things that the participants didn't want to bring up via Slack because of other organizational dysfunction.

Most things that often end up in standup can or should be addressed via other channels, in my opinion:
* raising blockers: this should be done ASAP instead of waiting for standup
* progress on work: stakeholders should look at the ticket tracker, ask questions if unclear, and improve the process if frequently unclear
* socializing greater themes and workstreams: better suited for a non-daily standup, synchronous or asynchronous

I'm always eager to participate in whatever form of standup my team feels is most valuable, and am generally invested in improving the process alongside my team.

# Development

## Programming

As a default, I like to go low-meetings and heads-down in order to get things done. When heads-down, I usually defer Slack messages until my focus is already broken so that I can maximize progress on what I'm working on.

### Pairing

I love working in a culture where my colleagues and I can reach out to each other for ad-hoc questions and pairing sessions. I find this to be a huge productivity boost, a help in knowledge sharing, and it helps keep me feeling connected to my coworkers while working remotely. (This does require trusting your coworkers to say no when they're busy, and to feel comfortable deferring/referring out people when you're heads-down.)

I like doing classic driver/navigator pairing when appropriate, though sometimes just walking through the code or a concept is a little more effective depending on the problem at hand.

## Planning

The planning process deserves its own doc, but to put it as tersely as possible, planning should:
* Take time/care proportional to the complexity of the project
* Take input from as many people as is helpful, but be the ultimate responsibility and decision of the lead
  * This is to stop from constant, long-running consensus-building that stalls projects. GitLab has a take on [RACI charts](https://www.teamgantt.com/blog/raci-chart-definition-tips-and-example) that calls out ["directly-responsible individuals"](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci) that I constantly reference.
* Is a continual tradeoff between scope, time, and resources

When planning larger, complex projects, my goal is that I achieve enough clarity and completeness to be able to hand the project off to someone else as easily as I could complete it myself.

## Choosing tools

Like any engineer of sufficient tenure, I've seen plenty of:
* complex tools chosen when a simple one would suffice
* simple tools chosen when a complex one was needed
* builds when we should've bought
* buys when we should've built

I haven't held the checkbook or been in the lead architect's seat, so I can't criticize here, only learn from what I've seen and try to minimize my future regrets.

Generally speaking, I don't believe that there are good or bad* tools - there are right and wrongs problem to use them on.

*ok, _some_ tools are bad, but those are outliers.

## Monitoring and observability

Check out my observability doc for a lot of pontificating on monitoring/observability.

# Values

I take these values into all areas in my life, especially my work.

## Trust

Everything is smoother, faster, and feels better when people trust each other. You spend less time talking, crafting words, explaining, hand-wringing, when people (yourself included):
- assume good intent
- ask questions if they don't understand something
- push back if they disagree with you
- keep an open and collaborative spirit

We're not all perfect all the time, but should also trust each other to get back up when we stumble too.

Trust is slow to grow and quick to erode. In other words, it's expensive. I'd rather take on the burden of doing something hard (usually an uncomfortable conversation) than to pay the cost of breaking someone's trust.

Conversely, if my trust is broken, I simply have to spend a little more time on that person or system (emotionally, strategically) than I would with one that I have more trust in.

## Do the right thing

* The things I make should improve people's lives.
* I should help and uplift the people around me.

Everything follows from that.

## Pace yourself

I've done crunch work for months on end over and over and burned out again and again. I've done the same thing in my personal life - ramped up a workout plan too fast and injured myself, went too deep on a project and lost the plot, I could go on. It's not sustainable. Occasional crunch is unavoidable but doing it as a way of life isn't.

I work hard when I'm working and unplug when I'm not. I am only ever rewarded for respecting my body and my mind's need for rest.

## It should be fun

Sure it's work, but it can still be fun.

Solving puzzles is fun (any problem, large or small, is a puzzle).
Finding a better way to do something is fun.
Using a satisfying tool (like a modal text editor) is fun.
Learning something new is fun.
Teaching things is fun.

It's work, but it should be fun.
