Tools I like to use, communication style, expectations I have for myself, etc.

# Communication

I bias towards async communication. GitLab has [a great handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) about the how & why of good async comms.

That said, the best communication style is the one that works for both people. When I work with someone who prefers quick calls, I do quick calls. If they prefer scheduled meetings, I do that. I just find that structured async comms are my preferred method.

## Slack
I like to communicate in public group channels as much as possible. This way:
* everyone benefits from the conversation
* duplication of efforts is minimized
* people who you often wouldn't expect have an opportunity to join the conversation and provide valuable context/perspective
* it acts as a form of medium-term documentation

I don't install Slack on my phone unless it's a requirement for the team/company/duration of on-call shift. Because of that, feel free to message or @ me whenever, and I'll get to it when I'm next available!

# PR Review

* I do it proactively when I come up for air between tasks, or beginning-of-day when I'm fresh.
* If you need something sooner, or it's been ~24hr since you last requested my review (passively or actively), please DM me! I can't prioritize if I don't know something's a priority (and sometimes I just forget things).
* I use the [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) style as a guideline for how I format my comments.
