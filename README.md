# about-dev

Stuff I enjoyed reading about development, how I like to work, etc.

I held off on something like this for a long time because it feels presumptuous for me to write any of it down. If my thoughts matter to you in some way, then we probably work together and we're probably chatting about these things. That said, I started putting this together to centralize some links to articles I like, and give people a little insight into my perspective on their own time.
