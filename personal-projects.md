# Personal projects

You won't find a lot of personal project repos on my GitHub right now. My personal time related to tech is mostly spent on reading books and using my technical skills to enrich my life.

## Books

The tech-related book that's had the biggest impact on my day-to-day is probably Bob Martin's _Clean Agile_, surprisingly. As a growing engineer, I needed guidance on what agile is and is not. More importantly, I came away with clear opinions about engineering and product's responsibilities to each other.

I'm currently deepening my Ruby skills with Paolo Perotta's _Metaprogramming Ruby_ and Noel Rappin's _Modern Front-End Development for Rails_, with others from the Pragmatic Programmer offerings in my backlog. I finished Alexander Dymo's _Ruby Performance Optimization_ a while back and got a lot out of it, but need more reps with the concepts to really internalize them.

There's a few other books and courses I've worked through that I didn't find quite as valuable.
